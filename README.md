🧠 How It Works

FitDash uses your age, weight, height, gender, and activity level
to calculate your BMR and TDEE, providing a personalized calorie surplus or deficit.

The workout planner builds weekly splits based on:

Training days per week

Experience level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)

Equipment (Home / Gym)

Both modules export clean, formatted PDF reports for easy reference.
